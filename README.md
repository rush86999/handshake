Welcome to Handshake

The open-source alternative to Calendly that is convenient and polite

## Status
This project is just started and there is no workable code here yet! No releases yet!

## Scheduling that works for everyone

Calendly works many scenarios but there is a strong critic about Calendly. It enforces the sender's availability onto the receive. Try sending a Calendly link to your boss and see how it goes ðŸ˜†. Some find this offensive for not respecting the receiver's availability. Handshake solves this by finding common availability for both sides and letting the receiver choose the best time that is convenient for them.
